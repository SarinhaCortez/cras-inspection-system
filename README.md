# cras-inspection-system
I created this platform in the context of my internship at INESC-TEC. The previous Atlantis project developed autonomous robots to inspect the a floating offshore wind farm. My role was to develop a full-stack system using an AI model in PyTorch to analyze drone images for defect identification in photovoltaic panels and wind turbines.
